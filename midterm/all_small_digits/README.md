## Midterm Chegg Information

To summarize, there's a lot of cheating on this midterm, basically if the solution you're reading doesn't use `assert()`, just go ahead and check the repo, it's likely taken from Chegg.

If I missed a link, send a message on Teams and I'll add it, you can even make a PR and I'll check it.
